# Risk Management Plan and Security Controls
*Based off threat model and assets on the network*

***Two policies to implement based off the most serious threats in the threat model***

**1. Setting strict requirements for household members to _secure their own devices_**

One of the most serious threats as outlined in the security threat model is the *vulnerability of network devices within the household*. 

*WiFi Restriction*
The WiFi range extends far beyond the necessary requirements for the household, meaning other hostile attackers can access the network from outside of the house. A suggestion is to reduce the WiFi range to a reasonable range to allow only the household to access the network.

*Password Protection*
Since the household may contain sensitive and restricted data, as well as personal data, to avoid loss or potential damage to the company that the executive works for, necessary security over these devices should be implemented. All members of the household should upgrade their password to a passphrase, which will ensure that brute-forcing passwords are made increasingly difficult. 

*Education in Security*
Furthermore, all members of the household should be educated in security, so that they understand appropriate and inappropriate behaviour when browsing the internet, for example not entering websites that are blocked by the firewall, or implementing an anti-virus software that can routinely scan for threats. If a device is lost, it should be immediately reported to the leader of the family. Most importantly, it should be noted that all devices should be stored somewhere safe, and this should be intuitive, since no-one would like to have their devices stolen.

*Encryption*
Any communication with the company through the use of a personal device should be encrypted. This means that it is recommended that the executive should implement new software that can accomplish that. Moreover, implementing a full disk encryption to devices should be able to make sure that even when losing the device no data can be exfiltrated.

*Update to latest patch*
All devices should be updated to the latest patch, so that no pre-existing vulnerabilities that are readily available on the internet can be used by an unskilled hacker to infiltrate the system.

**2. Securing the _physical aspect_ of the household**

Another critical threat to the household is that of the lack of physical protection. A breach in the physical space of the household can lead to the breach of network indirectly, and therefore these elements should also be addressed.

*Security against visitation*
When there are visitors to the household, may sure that they are routinely accompanied, especially while around sensitive devices. Make sure that they are not within proximity to accessing or stealing any devices. While there is an element of trust involved, it is always important to be cautious just in case some people visit for malicious reasons.

*Physical location of network assets*
It is recommended to store the network assets in a safe location, such as placing the WiFi router on a table and not on the kitchen bench. This can prevent possible accidents as the kitchen is a place where things can get dirty or damaged. This is an internal issue that should be mitigated. 

*Upgrading physical assets*
There are dangers associated with overhead powerlines because potential outages can cause signficant problems for the family, especially if the senior executive is working. Investing in a backup power source that can last for several hours to a day can help address this issue. Moreover, having significant mobile data can be helpful to preventing internet outage related problems. It is recommended to scale up to a business plan if the area they live in is fairly prone to frequent outages.

*Purchasing new landline phone*
Due to the lack of a functioning home phone capability to connect to a security response company, any immediate breach may result in long waits and a lack of timely fixes, which may cause greater damage than is expected. Implementing a new phone which directly connects to the response company can ensure damage is controlled as soon as possible.

*Securing back fence through security cameras*
Due to the proximity of the house to the public park, there is an access pathway in which physical attackers can enter. By having security cameras in the backyard, it will be easier to track potential intruders, and notify the relevant authorities with evidence. 

# Timeline and budget of security policies

Due to the urgency of the threat model, the time frame should be as compact as possible.

Day One:
1. Implement WiFi restrictions
2. Increase password protection
3. Edit: Upgrade Windows 8.1 to the latest patch, as well as other devices, such as the iOS phones, also upgrade the router firmware if possible.
4. Improve the physical location of network assets, so that they are more secure. This can be done by purchasing a new table to place the router on, for example ~= $100
5. Edit: Signing up to a response team service

Day Two:
1. Teach household members about security --> education costs ~= $500
2. Full disk encryption using Check Point Full Disk Encryption (Windows 8) ~= $300

Day Three:
1. Purchase and connect a new landline phone, and configure so that it can directly connect to response team ~= $100
2. Upgrading physical assets by purchasing a new mobile plan, and purchasing a backup source of power ~= $1000

Before EO Week 1:
1. Purchase security cameras to secure the proximity, especially the back fence ~= $2500
2. Edit: Install these security cameras around the proximity of the house, and configure and set up these cameras.

Constant monitoring:
1. Security against visitation, so that household is always aware of visitors and their actions

Total budget that should be allocated for security policies: $4500

# Risk Management Plan for client

Dear Senior Executive,

After surveying your house, we have determined several critical security weaknesses that we would recommend to be implemented as soon as possible.

Firstly, we recommend to immediately implement strict WiFi restrictions, increase the password protection and upgrade to the latest patch for all devices. Moreover, please shift the location of network assets to more secure and safe locations. If possible, please purchase a table for your network router. Please also make sure to implement full disk encryption that we have prepared for you as soon as possible, preferably within the next two days. All together this should be no more than $400. 

Secondly, after that we would recommend you to undertake our security workshop to gain insight into security. We have a class in two days time for $500 each household. 

Thirdly, within the week, please purchase a new landline phone, so that our company can configure a direct connection to our response team, incase of a security emergency. Moreover, please purchase a new mobile plan for more data, and a backup source of power to secure the physical aspect of your household. This should cost no more than $1200.

Lastly, we recommend you to purchase security cameras to install in the backyard, as it is close to a public area. This should cost no more than $2500. If possible, please make sure that any visitation is also accompanied by cautiousness, so that no device will be missing or stolen.

# Maintain Security Controls

Continous review should be implemented to ensure that security controls are always at a maximum. Several steps are suggested to ensure breaches will not occur:
1. Regularly update passwords/passphrases for all devices, preferably once every 3 to 6 months.
2. Continuously monitoring visitors, and refrain from inviting visitors who you do not know very well.
3. Ensure that all patches are up to date, and regularly check for any existing patches for all software.
4. Ensure all assets are fully functional, and replace any that become obsolete.
5. Ensure all the security procedures are applied to each new device that enters the household.

**Provide evidence you have received feedback from a industry expert on your risk management plan, and how you have modified your approach based on feedback (notes on feedback or written feedback from industry expert in addition to 100 - 200 words on your response to this feedback.**

There are several adjustments that were made to the risk management plan based off the feedback. The most important adjustments have `Edit:` to show that they have been modified. The approach is to be more concise with explaining security policies, especially regarding the timeliness of the policies.
