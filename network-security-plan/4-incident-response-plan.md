# Auditing and Incident Response Plan

***Incident***
The situation arose from an assailant from a nearby house who realised that the WiFi extended past the household's desired range and into some areas of their house. The neighbour is an expert gray hat penetration tester and realised that his neighbour was a senior executive at a company that rivaled his. He managed to exploit some vulnerabilities of the router, and through that vulnerability was able to intercept traffic from all the devices in the household. The main device which contained sensitive information had a signficant and emerging remote code execution vulnerability, and since the household did not patch regularly, this vulnerability was exploited, and control of the device was established. The assailant then retrieves all the information regarding the company from the device, and sold it on the black market of information to ruin the reputation of the company.

The Network Security Plan sufficiently addresses the incident through the use of a threat plan, which measures the likeliness and severity of potential incidents. All the crucial assets within a system/household are identified, and the level of protection for these devices are measured. We have also developed a risk management process and informed the household of the necessary procedures to ensure maximal protection against any breach that can occur. Through education, each member is informed of their role and the level of security that needs to be maintained. Many tools and suggestions are all implemented, with a time and budget cost proposed. Finally, there are many continuous review to ensure that the security is constant and consistent.

***Auditing Checklist***

1. Check the firewall configuration, both hardware and software, in regards to accepted inbound and outbound traffic connections.
2. Check the anti-virus configuration to determine if there are malicious software on the server.
3. Check the log files to determine if a breach has/is occurred/occurring.
4. In order to prevent the incident, a penetration test of the network should be conducted to see if there are any exploitable attacking scopes.
5. Penetration tests of the router to determine whether the router is secure.

**Create a process, a list of steps, that should be followed should the incident occur, the process must include (200 - 300 words):**

If a security incident is discovered, or if any member of the household reasonably believes that a security incident is occurring or will soon to occur:

1. The leaders of the household are immediately responsible to contact the response team through the direct phone line.
2. The response team will give advice on what to do, and in severe circumstances, dispatch a team to the household.
3. The allocation of the responsibility will be given to the leaders of the household and the members of the dispatch team to determine the events of the breach.
4. The management and use of software and hardware related to the incident will be investigated by the dispatch team, and a digital forensics team will investigate it further unless it is unneccesary.
5. The team will continue to monitor for any external attacks, by tracking logs and relevant software in the previous step.
6. The software is audited, scanned for vulnerabilities, and configurations of the devices is checked. This may include the firewall, anti-virus and log files.
7. Create a penetration test to determine if there are any vulnerabilities, and whether exploits work against it.
